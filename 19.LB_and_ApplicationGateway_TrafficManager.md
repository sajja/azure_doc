# Load balancing in Azure

### Global

Both services provides geo-redundancy . If one region is unavailable, traffic is routed to the closest region

Traffic is routed to the closest region

####  	Azure Front Door

​	Is a layer 7 LB. Faster than Traffic Manager

​	<u>*Features*</u>

		* SSL termination, Path based routing, Caching, Fast failover

 * Can handle only HTTP based LB

 * Accelerated application performance by using **[split TCP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-routing-architecture#splittcp)**-based **[anycast protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-routing-architecture#anycast)**

 * Enables hosting of multiple websites for efficient application infrastructure.

 * Cookie-based **[session affinity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-routing-methods#affinity)**. (sticky session)

 * Application security with WAF

 * URL re-write

   

#### 	Traffic Manager 

It uses DNS to redirect requests to an appropriate geographical location endpoint. The backend pool supports any public DNS CNAME

​	<u>*Features*</u>

	* When there are changes in the backend dns, it takes a while to propagate
	* suitable for scenarios where requests are targeted to both the on-premise application and cloud application



### Regional 

#### Load balancer (ALB)

Provides LB for azure VM's or `VM Scale Set`

Handles traffic at layer4 (TCP/IP and UDP are bundled together at Layer 4)

 Azure Load Balancer provides basic load balancing

Load Balancer only supports endpoints hosted in Azure



#### Internal vs External

##### 					External

​	Provide one outbound endpoint for your VM's. Used to load balance your external (Internet) requests

##### 	Internal

​	Private IP is provided to frontend. Used for loadbalancing your internal requests.



#### Standard vs Basic SKU

Basic does not support availability zone only Availability set. Standard support both

Basic does not support outbound NAT ruels

Basic has no SLA

 Basic does not support HTTPS health probe protocol

### Create LB

1. Create the balancer

```bash
az network lb  create --resource-group sajithRG --name lb --frontend-ip-name fip --backend-pool-name bp --sku Standard 
```

2. Create the FrontendIP (if not created)
3. Create a backend pool (set the VNET)
4. Create a heath probe. This is the probe used ensure health of the backend pool.
5. Create a rule that maps frontend request to backend. It maps
   1. Frontend port -> backend port
   2. Backend pool 
   3. Health probe
   4. Sticky or not



#### Application Gateway

Application GW handles traffic at layer 7, which means HTTP,HTTPS and WebSockets only.

Application Gateway supports SSL termination

URL-based / content based routing

Cookie-based session affinity (Sticky session based on cookie)

Web Application Firewall (WAF) 

	* Provide SQL injection protection
	* Provides XSS attacks
	* DDOS

Application Gateway can support any routable IP address.

Connection draining -  Allows gracefully remove backend pool during planed service updates etc..
