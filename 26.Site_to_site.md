# Site to site



Connect on-prem network to azure over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel.



* requires a VPN device located on-premises that has an externally facing public IP address
* This is over public Internet, hence latency is high
* one site-to-site connections for a VNET, cannot connect multiple sites for the same network
* 





## Howto

1. Create a VNET

2. Create a GW subnet 

3. Create a VPN GW

4. Note: VPN GW should be in same RG as VNET

5. Assign the VNET

6. Create a new resource `Local Network Gateway`

   1. Provide public IP of the onprem VPN device
   2. Provides VNET address space (Subnet)

7. Then we need to create the site-to-site connection in the VPN GW

8. go to `Connections`->`add`

9. Select `connection typ` - Site to site

10. Select the local NW GW which we created in #6 

11. States of the connection will be still unknown since on-prem VPN is not yet configured

12. Go to the connection we just created, and download the configuration script for the on-prem VPN device

13. Use this to configure the on-prem VPN device
