# Storage

- [Azure Blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction): A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also  includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- [Azure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction): Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- [Azure Queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction): A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
- [Azure Tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview): A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
- [Azure Disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview): Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.



### Azure Blobs

This is the S3 equivalent offering. However `Azure Blobs` is not S3 compliant at the time of writing

Blob storage is designed for:

- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Writing to log files.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.



### Azure Files

[Azure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) enables you to set up highly available network file shares that can be  accessed by using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol

TTL url with `shared access signature (SAS) token` can be generated and shared so the files can be accesed

Common usecase would be a file server. Files is similar to NAS.

### Security

* Azure RBAC for access management and control
* Azure Defender for detecting anomalies and exploits. Alerts are triggered. 
* Soft delete for recovery
* Lock storage account to prevent accident deletion of the storage account
* TTL access url's

### Networking

* **Secure transfer required**  - Enable SSL
* Enable firewall - Limit access for specific IP ranges/subnets in azure VNET
* Allow trusted Microsoft services to access the storage account 
* Use private endpoints - `private endpoint` assigns a private IP to storage account. 



## BLOB

view keys

```
 az storage account keys list --account-name sajithstorage
```

list containers

```
az storage blob list --account-name sajithstorage --container-name customer --output table --auth-mode key --account-key <<KEY>>
```

upload

```
az storage blob upload \
    --account-name sajithstorage \
    --container-name customer \
    --name helloworld \
    --file helloworld \
    --auth-mode key

```



#### Networking

##### Microsoft network routing

This will direct traffic and client will enter azure closest point

##### Internet routing

This will make client enter azurecloud closest to the storage account

#### Shared access signature

Conditionally allow a blob in private container to be accessed.

Key based SAS uses Storage account KEY1 or KEY2 to sign SAS. If you want to revoke, you need to change the key hence breaking all other SAS generated


User delegation key



#### Replication

##### 		Object replication

​	Allows one storage account objects to be replicated to another async

​	Create another storage account (could be in different region), setup the destination account/container and u r set.

##### Geo Replication	

​	If the storage is geo redundancy enabled, you can setup failover for the Secondary region. It will take few min 

​	Once failover for secondary region is complete, account replication will be set to LRS. Then it can be manually converted to Geo - redundant later.

# Storage Account



**GPv2** support access tiering (Hot, Cool, Archive)

**GPv1** (Hot, Cool, Archive) not supported

**BlockBlobStorage**: Storage accounts with premium performance, *Usecase:* High Tx rates

**BlobStorage**: Legacy blob storage



### Storage account redundancy

​	**Locally redundant storage**

​	Low cost redundancy. 3 copies are stored in the primary region

​	**Zone-redundant storage**

​	Copied across three availability zones in the primary region

​	**Geo-redundant storage** 

​	Cross region redundancy, to guard against regional outages. Data copied 3 times in primary region (sync). 

​	Data copied (1) another region (Async). You cannot read from secondary region.

​	**Geo-zone-redundant storage** 

​	3 copies are stored (Sync) across 3 availability zones in the primary region.

​	Data is copied another region asyn. You cannot read from secondary region.

​	**Read access Geo-zone-redundant storage** 

​	You need this to read from secondary zone

​	**Read access Geo-redundant storage** 

​	You need this to read from secondary zone



### Azure defender

Azure-native layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and  potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts.

1. Blob storage
2. Azure files
3. Data lake Gen 2
