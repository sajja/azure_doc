Cloud based identity management service

Identity & Access management (IAM)



### Hybrid identity

When you have onprem identity.

1. cloud authentication

   Azure AD handles user authentication, SSO

2. Password has synchronization

   Simples way to authenticate on-prem users. Password hash is synchronized the Azure. Users can use same UN/PW to login to azure AD

3. Pass through authentication

   On prem server does the password authentication, via an agent running in on-prem server

4. Federation

   Azure AD uses trusted IDP (ie. ADFS) for authentication. These IDP's allows advanced authentication(ie. Multifactor)

5.

### AD Connect

1. Password has sync
2. Pass-through authentication -  
3. Federation integration - optional part of Ad connect. Allows ADFS federation
4. Synchronization - Responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects.  As well as,  making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups  is matching the cloud.  This synchronization also includes password  hashes.



**Connector space**

a staging area that contains representations of the designated objects  from a connected data source and the attributes specified in the  attribute inclusion list. The sync engine uses the connector space to  determine what has changed in the connected data source and to stage  incoming changes. The sync engine also uses the connector space to stage outgoing changes for export to the connected data source



**Metaverse**

a storage area that contains the aggregated identity information from  multiple connected data sources, providing a single global, integrated  view of all combined objects





#### Sync Rules

Inbound/outbound rules

Local/Azure AD has different properties. During sync these properties should be mapped so the data can be synced. Rules define how the data is mapped.



#### ADFS
