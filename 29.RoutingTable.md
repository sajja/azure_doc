# Routing table



Defines rules for resouces  in communicate with each other

`VM->Networking-Effective routes` define the routes applied for a VM



If the target address matches a given address prefix of a routing rule, that will be applied

This allows VM to talk to any resource in a different subnet within same VNET

```
Default|Active|10.1.0.0/16|Virtual network
```

This allows outbound internet traffic

```
Default|Active|0.0.0.0/0|Internet
```

Blocks any traffic to 192.168.0.0/16  since `next hop type is none`

```
Default | Active | 192.168.0.0/16 | None
```



Allows a VNET to communicate to a Gateway subnet with ip 192.168.0.0/16

```
VnetGw | Active | 192.168.0.0/16 | VnetGw
```



Peered VNET communication

```
Default|Active|10.1.0.0/16|Virtual network peering
```

If you want to route traffic via a virtual appliance (VM with network software. ie: Firewall )

```
192.168.1.0/24|Virtual appliance|10.3.1.2
```
