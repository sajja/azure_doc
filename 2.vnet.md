# Virtual Networks



Subnet

Subnet mask

**BastionHost** - special-purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. System identified by the firewall administrator as a critical strong point in the [network security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security). Generally, bastion hosts will have some degree of extra attention paid  to their security, may undergo regular audits, and may have modified  software







### Connecting two VNETS

### Peering

Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more [Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) in Azure.



##### Types of peering

<u>Virtual network peering</u>

Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.

Peered networs should have non-overlapping subnets



<u>Global virtual network peering</u>

Over multiple regions



#### Benefits of peering

- A low-latency, high-bandwidth connection between resources in different virtual networks.

- The ability for resources in one virtual network to communicate with resources in a different virtual network.

- The ability to transfer data between virtual networks across Azure  subscriptions, Azure Active Directory tenants, deployment models, and  Azure regions.

- The ability to peer virtual networks created through the Azure Resource Manager.

- The ability to peer a virtual network created through Resource  Manager to one created through the classic deployment model. To learn  more about Azure deployment models, see [Understand Azure deployment models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/deployment-models?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json).

- No downtime to resources in either virtual network when creating the peering, or after the peering is created.

  

The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks is  routed directly through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, not  through a gateway or over the public Internet.



<u>Non transitive</u>: 

vnet1<-->vnet2 (peered)

vnet1<-->vnet3(peered)

This does not mean no transit communication is allowed from vnet2<-->vnet3	



**Gateway transit** ????





#### Setup

*(1st section)Traffic to remote virtual network*: This prevents communication from remote VNET to local

This prevents traffic from remote VNET reaching the local VNET



*(2nd section)Traffic to remote virtual network*: This prevents communication from local VNET to remote: 

**TODO: This did not work as expected.**

## Virtual network gateway



A virtual network gateway is composed of two or more VMs that are deployed to a specific subnet you create called the *gateway subnet*. Virtual network gateway VMs contain routing tables and run specific  gateway services. These VMs are created when you create the virtual  network gateway. You can't directly configure the VMs that are part of  the virtual network gateway.





### Open a port to expose external traffic

1. Create `Network security group`
2. Create  an `Inbound rule`. Make sure priority value is numerically lower (high priority) than default deny rules.
3. Associate NSG with the Vnet by choosing `NSG`->`Subnet`->Associate
4.
