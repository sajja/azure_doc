# Implement VMs for Windows and Linux

### Configure High Availability

Read: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/checklist/resiliency-per-service

An Availability Zone is a physically separate zone, within an Azure region. Each Availability Zone has a distinct power source, network, and cooling. 

In azure each region consists of multiple Data centers. Availability zone is a physical and logical grouping of these DC's. For each region there are 3 AZ's

### Configure storage for VMs

#### Types of disks

1. Ultra -  for high end db (I could not find how to create this). IO intensive workloads
2. Prem. SSD -  for production and performance sensitive workloads
3. standard ssd - web servers, lightly used applications
4. hdd - Archive/backup etc...

### <u>Select virtual machine size</u>

//What to study here ???/



### <u>SLA</u>

1. Two or more instances deployed over two or more AZ in the same region 99.99%

2. Two or more instances on same Availability Set 99.95%

3. Same dedicated host group 99.95%

   

### <u>Implement Azure Dedicated Host</u>

Provides physical servers, which is able to host one or more VM's





### <u>Deploy and configure scale sets</u>

1. Create  a disk image with back-end installed. ie. web server with application deployed. This will be used as the template for our scaleset VM

2. Create a scaleset and defined scaleout policy

   #### <u>Custom applications in scale set</u>

   When scaling out, application need to be provisioned, software needs to be installed.

   Azure custom script extension can be added from extension blade on VM and configured. 
   
   - Extensions can be installed installation in advanced tab
   
   - Extensions blade in VM
   
   - ARM template 
   
     ```json
     "properties": {
           "publisher": "Microsoft.Compute",
           "type": "CustomScriptExtension",
           "typeHandlerVersion": "1.7",
           "autoUpgradeMinorVersion":true,
           "settings": {
             "fileUris": [
               <<script location>>
             ],
             "commandToExecute": "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File installWebServer.ps1"
           }
     ```
   
     



### <u>Azure image</u>

1. Use capture to create a disk image
2. Navigate to shared images and use create vm to create an VM from captured image 


### configure Azure Disk Encryption

1. 



#### Backup

1. Create recover services vault (This is the place to manage your backups, recent backups, find errors, schedule)
2. Create VM backup policy in recover services vault (this can define when/how frequant backups should be made)
3. Then use the recover service vault or backup manager to create backup



#### Restore

1. Go to Recover services vault
2. Select a backup
3. Select restore
4. Select restoration point
5. 

### Disaster recovery

Only VMs which availability zone redundancy is illegible for zonal disaster recovery

 



### Sizes

1. General purpose - Balanced (test/dev, low traffic web services) (BAD)

2. Compute - High cput/memory ratio  - Medium traf. web servers, Application servers (F)

3. Memory optimized High memory/CPU - cache, databases, (E)

4. Storage - SQL/NoSQL (ELS)

5. GPU - video rendering, deep learning

    

   

   ### Azure Metadata service

   Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) provides information about currently running virtual machine instances
