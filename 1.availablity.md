# Azure Availablity



##### <u>Fault domain</u>: 3 FD for Single Availability Set

A fault domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that share a  common power source and network switch, similar to a rack within an  on-premises datacenter.

##### <u>Update domain</u>: 20 UP for single AS

An update domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time. Only one update domain is rebooted at a time  



##### <u>Availability set</u>

In an availability set, VMs are automatically distributed across  fault domains.

VMs within an availability set are also automatically distributed across update domains.

**Observe**: Create separate availability set for each workload. 

ie. Your DB servers should be on one AS, so they are created across fault domains. If you dont do this, you could end up all your dbs in one FD and your webapps  in the other FD. When one FD fails, your availability is compromised



##### <u>Availability zones</u>

An Availability Zone is a physically separate zone, within an Azure region. Each Availability Zone has a distinct power source, network, and cooling. 

In azure each region consists of multiple Data centers. Availability zone is a physical and logical grouping of these DC's. For each region there are 3 AZ's

It can be considered as a combination of a fault domain and an update domain.

**ie.** *if you create three or more VMs across three zones in an Azure region,  your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and  three update domains. The Azure platform recognizes this distribution  across update domains to make sure that VMs in different zones are not  scheduled to be updated at the same time.*

**Zonal services** – where a resource is pinned to a specific zone (for example, virtual machines, managed disks, Standard IP addresses)

**Zone-redundant services** – when the Azure platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).



**To achieve comprehensive business continuity on Azure, build your  application architecture using the combination of Availability Zones  with Azure region pairs. You can synchronously replicate your  applications and data using Availability Zones within an Azure region  for high-availability and asynchronously replicate across Azure regions  for disaster recovery protection.**
