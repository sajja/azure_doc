# Azure SQL



### SQL Database

* fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine that handles  most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching,  backups, and monitoring without user involvement. 
* There are set of limitations compared to on prem sql server
* Configuration is scoped database. You dont have access to DBMS level configuration



### Deployment models

#### Single

​	Fully managed isolated instance

​	

#### Elastic pool

​	Collection of single databases, which share set of resource. ie. CPU Memory





#### Connecting to database

- Whitelist client IP in the sql server firewall

#### Purchasing models

1. DTU based (Basic , Standard, Premium)

   1. IOPS differ (based on the model)
   2. CPU is better (based on the model)
   3. IO latency is lower (based on the model)
   4. Premium allows zone redundancy  and Read scale out

2. vCore based

   * General purpose / Bis.Crit allows zone redundancy 
   * Cannot change from hyperscale to another tier

   1. General purpose

   2. Hyperscale

   3. Business critical

      

### Azure Managed instance

This model removes the limitations of the Azure database.

You get full fledged db server instead of a database as a service where you loose control of the DBMS

Get a full SQL server and its features with managed functionality like availability security 



When to use what



OS level access to SQL server, Require 3rdparty software to be installed

- Use SQL Server in a VM

Full control over SQL Server (not os)

* Managed instance

Fully manage the DB but not the DBMS, just need a managed database

* Azure database

Multi tenant, Share resource among databases, cost reduction

* Elastic pool



### Pools

cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases that have varying and unpredictable usage demands

The databases in an elastic pool are on a single server and share a set number of resources at a set price.

Databases can be added to the pool only on the same region, regardless of the underlaying sqlserver instances

#### 			Use cases

​		cases where low average utilization with relatively infrequent utilization spikes

### Scaling 

Scaling can be done via compute/storage setting on a database, or configure blade in your pool



### Elastic database transactions 

* transactions that span several databases 
* Applies to Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance
