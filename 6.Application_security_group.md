# Application Security Group



Application security groups enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group  virtual machines and define network security policies based on those  groups



![Application security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/media/security-groups/application-security-groups.png)



you can group VM's into different ASG's and ALLOW/DENY access based on these ASG's

ie. You can DENY ssh traffic to your databases (which are in one ASG) from all your SFTP servers (sftp ASG) and vise versa you can ALLOW traffic.



### Asosiate

VM->Networking->Application Security Group->(select the NSG)

### Configure

VM->Networking->Inbound / Outbound port rule -> Source -> (Select correct ASG)
