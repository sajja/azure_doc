# Monitoring cloud infrastructure

### Diagnostic logs (Storage)

1. Enable on diagnostic blade
2. Metrics data is stored in  table storage, in separate hour/miniute/blob/file/queue etc..
3. Logging data is stored in blob storage

### Diagnostic logs (AppService)

1. Again on Diagnostics page, you can enable logging.
2. Application loggin/Webserver logging can be enabled
3. Log stream -  Application logs needs to be enabled to see realtime logs



### Monitor unused resources

1. Use VM metrics, create rule, create action group and setup alerting
2. Azure advisor 
   1. HA advice
   2. security 
   3. Performance
   4. Cost - optimize / reduce 

### Monitor performance (VM)

1. Performance and diagnostics blade
   1. install PerfInsights tool in the VM
   2. Needs a storage account, if not specified, a new one is created.
   3. Types of analysis available
      1. Quick
      2. Perf analysis
      3. 
2. 



### Monitor cost

1. Subscription->Cost analysis
2. Advisor recommendations
3. Subscription->alerts
4. Cost management ->create budget -> create a notification rule (with action group)
5. Use Resource group->budget->create a notification rule (with action group)

### Insights

install a small instrumentation package (SDK) in your application or  enable Application Insights using the Application Insights Agent when [supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/platforms)



Two types of data collected

#### Metrics

#### Logs



Azure monitor collects following data

- Data about the code you have written. (Using Instrumentation SDK's)
- Guest OS monitoring
- Azure resource monitoring data
- Subscription
- Tenant 





## Insights 

[Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/monitor-reference#insights-and-core-solutions) provide a customized monitoring experience for particular Azure  services. They require minimal configuration and increase your  visibility into the operation of critical resources.

#### 	VM insights

​		Installs instrumentation agent in the supported platform (VM, Appservice, ASP .NET, Functions) 

#### 	Application insights 

##### 	Code based

​		Added instrumentation library for your application so the data can be gathered.

​			*The Node.js SDK*

​			This can be added to your  nodejs application so that  it can monitor incoming and outgoing HTTP requests, exceptions,

​			and some system metrics

##### 	Code less

​		Auto instrumentation

  1. VM

     add an automated agent in the vm to gather insights

  2. App services

     *Agent based* - agent is installed in app services

     *Manual* - Code is inserted which provides insights 

  3. Functions - Provides built-in support for insights







#### Usage analysis

 1. Funnel

    How the users engage with your application. Where the user terminates the flow. 

 2. Cohorts

    A cohort is a set of users, sessions, events, or operations that have something in common.

 3. Impact

    How load time impacts conversions 

 4. Retention

    How many users returns to you

 5. User flow

    How users navigate your pages,

    What are the most interesting areas

 6. Usage analytics 

	##### Types of insights

1. 

#### Container insights

​		 monitors the performance of container workloads that are deployed to managed Kubernetes clusters



#### Time series insights







## VM monitoring

1. Metrics

   *Platform metrics*

   These are host os metrics 

   *Guest operating system*

   You need an agent installed in Guest OS

   You need a storage account to store data

   Both guest/host are coming from same VM. Host metrics used for scale up/down. 

####  VM insights - workbooks

1. Performance counters
2. Network connections

#### VM insights 

1. Performance view (Disk io , memory CPU)
2. Map (Ports, workbooks of perf counters / network)
3. Health (can setup alert on cpu/memory/FS)



### Rules

Rule consists of following

1. Condition - Rule triggering action/event etc..
2. Action - This defines which actions to be taken when a rule triggers
   1. Action group 
      * defines notification list to be performed when action is run (email/sms/push notifications/voice notification)
      * defines what are the actions to be taken when it is run (Azure fn,  Automation Runbook, Webhook, logic app)



#### Runbooks

Cloud based automation and configuration service. It includes following,

1. Process automation
2. Update management
3. Configuration management



## Cost management



### Cost management & Billing section
