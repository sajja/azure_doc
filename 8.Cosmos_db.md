# Cosmos DB

Data stored in CosmosDB is a globally distributed database system that allows you to read and write data from the local replicas of the database. Azure Cosmos DB transparently replicates the data to all the regions associated with your Cosmos account

#### Container

* An Azure Cosmos container is the fundamental unit of scalability
* A container is horizontally partitioned and then replicated across multiple regions
* The items that you add to the container are automatically grouped into  logical partitions, which are distributed across physical partitions,  based on the partition key
* Depending on the API used, container is realized as 
  * Column family
  * Key-value
  * Table
  * Graph

#### Cosmos items

Depending on which API you use, an Azure Cosmos item can represent  either a document in a collection, a row in a table, or a node or edge  in a graph



#### Consistency levels

- *Strong*
- *Bounded staleness*
- *Session*
- *Consistent prefix*
- *Eventual*

#### Scaling

* Partitioning is use to scale individual containers.
* Each container is `logically` partitioned based on a `partition key`
* ie: if the container is partitioned with `user_id` and there are 10K unique `user_id's` in the container, you have 10K logical partitions
* Each item also has `itemID` which is unique for given `partition`. Consider this as a primary key for that partition. 
* Combination of these two keys, a record can be uniquely identified



#### Physical Partitions

one or more logical partitions are mapped to a single physical partition



#### Costing

The cost of all database operations is normalized by Azure Cosmos DB and is expressed by Request Units (or RUs, for short). Request unit is a  performance currency abstracting the system resources such as CPU, IOPS, and memory that are required to perform the database operations  supported by Azure Cosmos DB.



#### Security



#### Global distribution

Cosmos DB has a turnkey distribution. You can add regions with few clicks.

You cannot add Multi-region writes for other regions if you have continuous backup mode



### Types of API

#### SQL API

1. Core SQL
   - Store data as JSON
   - Query as SQL
   - 
2. Mongodb (document)
   - Document
3. Cassandra 
   - Row
4. Table
   - Store none relational structured data
   - Large volumes 
5. Germalin(Graph)

### Analyze the decision criteria

New projects being created from scratch - Core SQL

Existing MongoDB, Cassandra, Azure Table, or Gremlin data - Mongo / Cass/ Table/ Gremlin in order

Analysis of the relationships between data - Gremlin

All other scenarios - Core SQL

## TODO

- [ ] azure synapse link - learn more
- [x] Create vms in diff region than other than the db, try access them. 
- [x] Create vnets for each vm and allow conditional access
- [x] Test firewall
- [ ] Scale
- [ ] Analytical store
- [ ] private endpoint
- [ ] learn core sql api query (cross partition etc..)
